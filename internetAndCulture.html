                <h2>Social Media</h2>
                <p>Social Media has become ubiquitous in Western culture, as an increasing proportion of people come to rely on it for filling their social needs. The utility of websites such as Facebook and Instagram has allowed these platforms to become powerful tools for not only their users, but also their curators - masses of data are being collected by companies to sell or utilise, tailoring advertisements and content to individuals. While it is clear that social media has allowed many people to reconnect with old friends, keep up with current ones and maintain relationships, it remains to be seen whether the backlash against companies like Facebook will change our patterns of consumption, or whether social media, and the loss of privacy that comes with it, is here to stay.

                    <h2>Internet Humour</h2>
                    <p>In many ways, the rise of the internet has redefined humour - jokes that can be quickly understood and spread online have become the norm, and image macros have surfaced as a new format. The word 'meme', first christened by Richard Dawkins to refer to ideas spread quickly throughout a system, has become synonymous with 'joke' online, and while many deride memes as a curse, pushing more complicated or nuanced humour into obscurity, it cannot be denied that the quantity and variety of humour on the internet has exploded in a staggering fashion, and will no doubt continue to do so as popular culture grows and evolves.</p>

                    <h2>An Internet Society</h2>
                    <p>With the internet becoming an integral part of daily life, our behaviour has become influenced by this new, often anonymous environment. The advent of 'trolls', people on the internet whose main intention is to ignite arguments, is merely a symptom of the effects the internet has had on how people act both on- and offline. Anonymity has allowed people to harass and attack others without consequence, and the need to be connected at all times means many people pay more attention to their smartphones or computers than to their surroundings. The popularisation of video games has come at the expense of offline hobbies, and many decry the time people devote to maintaining their online personas in contrast to their offline lives. While we may still be in the early stages of integrating the internet in our lives fully, worrying trends have already appeared, and it remains to be seen whether these issues will be solved in the future.</p>

                    <h2>A Universal Culture?</h2>
                    <p>The nature of the Internet has meant it defies geographical boundaries. Throughout history, the dissemination of culture has been blocked by mountains, rivers, and seas, leading to a clear split between different peoples and their cultures, whereas the Internet transcends these historical barriers and has allowed cultures to intermingle in an egalitarian manner online. This has resulted in a fairly unique 'internet culture', with its own in-jokes, cultural trends and history. Though the internet has historically been dominated by American and European users, an increasing number of users from different cultural backgrounds ahve helped shape the Internet recently, and the spread of Internet culture into the offline world has created a universal foundation for a world culture, based not on historical and geographical circumstances, but created anew by the combined efforts of humanity. Whether such a 'universal culture' will replace old ties remains a controversial question, however it is not that implausible to consider a world wherein everyone, from Boston to Baghdad, shares a common culture.</p>
                    <p>For an insight into the erosion of culture by the Internet, <a href="http://www.frankfuredi.com/article/how_the_internet_and_social_media_are_changing_culture1">this article</a> by sociologist Frank Furedi is a good start.
