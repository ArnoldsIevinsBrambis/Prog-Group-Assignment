		<h1> Artificial intelligence and society </h1>
		<br>
		<h2> What is A.I.? </h2>
		<p>
		Artificial Intelligence is designing machines that have the ability to think. <strong>It is the intelligence of machines </strong>. 
		<br>
		The very idea to create an artificial intelligence is to make the lives of humans easier. Researchers of artificial intelligence want 
		to bring in the emotional quotient to the machines along with the general intelligence.
		</p>
		
		<h2> Goals of A.I.</h2>
		<p>As we are totally surrounded by machines and computer systems, this gave humans a general thought like "Can a machine think and behave 
		like humans do?". Though this was a general thought, its curiosity leads to the development of Artificial Intelligence. 
		<br><br>
		A.I. has two main goals:
			<ul>
				<li> creating expert systems that have the ability to display intelligent behaviour, learn, demonstrate, explain, and provide the 
					users with best advices </li>
				<li> implementing intelligence in machines (develop systems which can understand, think, learn, and behave like humans)</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		<h2> Advantages and disadvantages </h2>
		<p>
		Artificial Intelligence is complex in nature. It uses very complicated mixture of computer science, mathematics and other complex sciences.
		Complex programming helps these machines replicate the cognitive abilities of human beings.
		<br> 
		That being said, it makes sense for A.I. to have both advantages and disadvantages:
		<br><br>

		<h2> Applications of A.I. in use today</h2>
		<p>
		Today's so-called A.I. systems are merely advanced machine learning software with extensive behavioral algorithms that adapt themselves to our
		likes and dislikes. While extremely useful, these machines aren't getting smarter in the existential sense, but they are improving their skills 
		and usefulness based on a large dataset. Here are some examples:

		<h2> Can it be dangerous? </h2>
		<p>
			Most researchers agree that a superintelligent A.I. is unlikely to exhibit human emotions like love or hate, and that there is no reason to 
			expect A.I. to become intentionally benevolent or malevolent. Instead, when considering how A.I. might become a risk, experts think two scenarios 
			most likely:
			<ul>
				<li>The A.I. is programmed to do something devastating</li>
				<li>The A.I. is programmed to do something beneficial, but it develops a destructive method for achieving its goal</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			A super-intelligent AI will be extremely good at accomplishing its goals, and if those goals aren't aligned with ours, we have a problem. 
			You're probably not an evil ant-hater who steps on ants out of malice, but if you're in charge of a hydroelectric green energy project and there's 
			an anthill in the region to be flooded, too bad for the ants. A key goal of AI safety research is to never place humanity in the position of those ants.
		</p>
		
		<h2> Evolution </h2>
		<p>
			The truth is that, whether or not true A.I. is out there or is actually a threat to our existence, there's no stopping its evolution 
			and its rise. Humans have always fixated themselves on improving life across every spectrum, and the use of technology has become the 
			vehicle for doing just that. And although the past 100 years have seen the most dramatic technological upheavals to life than in all of
			human history, the next 100 years is set to pave the way for a multi-generational leap forward.
			<br><br>
			This will be at the hands of artificial intelligence. A.I. will also become smarter, faster, more fluid and human-like thanks to the 
			inevitable rise of quantum computing. Quantum computers will not only solve all of life's most complex problems and mysteries regarding 
			the environment, aging, disease, war, poverty, famine, the origins of the universe and deep-space exploration, just to name a few, it'll 
			soon power all of our A.I. systems, acting as the brains of these super-human machines.
