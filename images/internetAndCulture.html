How the Internet has redefined culture:

<img src="images/dogeProg.jpg" width = "600" height = "400" alt = "me_irl">
<p>
For most of human history, the spread of <strong>culture</strong> has been confined by several factors: <br>
<ul>
<li>Geographical boundaries</li>
<li>Political barriers</li>
<li>Language and cultural differences</li>
</ul>
The spread of the internet around the world however has allowed an unprecedented transfer of cultural and societal knowledge around the globe,<br>
leading to the creation of a foundational <em>'global culture'</em> that transcends geographical and political boundaries.

a waste of time, but at least it'll an <em>enjoyable</em> one.
