      <h3>(and whilst not make money and benefit society)</h3>
      <p> Many people have aspects in their career and lifestyle that may inhibit ultimate productvity or efficiency.<br><br> Be it hurdles to  make company data more readable, a powerpoint more interactive or a website to share their latest work, that if they knew <em>a little</em> code, could be happily solved. <br> <br>
          Not only that, is the issue is likely be unique to them? <br>   No.<br> Sharing your solution, be it in app, website or other forms to the general public can allow contributions to societies potentail by providing a service as well as benefiting the creator financially (in itself a benefit to society). <strong></strong> </p>
      <p> <a href=https://www.codeacademy.com> CodeAcademy </a> is a amazing resource that I have found very enjoyable to use whislst learning html and python</p>
